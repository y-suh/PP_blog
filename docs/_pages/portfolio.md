## Introduction

**Hi. My name is Youngjoon and I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Irvine.**

<br/>

The driving force behind all my research is the unwavering support from my family. I have two beautiful daughters and a loving wife. We like to travel and explore new places. A lot of my creative thoughts actually stem from the interactions and experiences that I go through with my family.

## Education

Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Irvine

M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Irvine

B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul



## Research Interests

My researchâ€™s overarching objective is to gain fundamental insights into two-phase transport physics by linking surface design, real-time nucleation statistics, and heat transfer performances. The research efforts aim to bring transformational efficiency enhancements in energy, water, manufacturing processes, and electronics cooling by fundamentally manipulating liquid-solid-vapor interactions and transport phenomena across multiple length and time scales. 



## Hobby

When I have free time, I like creating art pieces based on my work. I think that both science and art are great avenues to express oneself. Science is fascinating because it is one of the most fundamental, yet powerful tools that we use to try to understand the world around us. We use science almost as a global language and it somehow brings us all together to tackle unresolved problems. While art may be a little more abstract than science, art has no boundaries. The unlimited ways art is expressed really helps you see things from new perspectives. 

I personally found myself finding so many interesting things that I wanted to share with my friends while I was conducting research. However, there always seemed to be a bit of a disconnect between the macro and micro worlds, which motivated me to start editing my SEM images. I strongly feel that we can start building bridges between the scientific and non-scientific community by expressing relatable ideas through art. 

Apart from science-art, I enjoy re-creating moments that I had with my family as well!
